  <h2><center>Ketanji Brown Jackson</h2>
  <h3><center>Early Life and Career </h3>
  <p> Jackson was born Ketanji Onyika Brown on September 14, 1970, in Washington, D.C. Her parents were both graduates of historically black colleges and universities. Her father, Johnny Brown, further attended the University of Miami School of Law and ultimately became the chief attorney for the Miami-Dade County School Board; her mother, Ellery, served as school principal at New World School of the Arts in Miami, Florida. In 1989, when Jackson was a freshman at Harvard, her uncle, Thomas Brown Jr., was sentenced to life in prison for a nonviolent cocaine conviction in which federal agents found 14 kilograms of cocaine, wrapped in duct tape, court records show. Years later, Jackson persuaded a law firm to take his case pro bono, and President Barack Obama eventually commuted his sentence. Another uncle, Calvin Ross, served as Miami's chief of police.

Jackson grew up in the Miami, Florida, area and attended Miami Palmetto Senior High School. In her senior year, she won the national oratory title at the National Catholic Forensic League championships in New Orleans. She is quoted in her high school yearbook saying that she "[wanted] to go into law and eventually have a judicial appointment." She graduated from Miami Palmetto in 1988.

Jackson then studied government at Harvard University, having applied to Harvard despite her high school guidance counselor's advice to set her sights lower. At Harvard, Jackson performed improv comedy and took classes in drama, and led protests against a student who displayed a Confederate flag from his dorm window. Jackson graduated from Harvard in 1992 with an A.B. magna cum laude. Her senior thesis was titled "The Hand of Oppression: Plea Bargaining Processes and the Coercion of Criminal Defendants".
    <br> </br>
Jackson worked as a staff reporter and researcher for Time magazine from 1992 to 1993, then attended Harvard Law School, where she was a supervising editor of the Harvard Law Review. She graduated in 1996 with a Juris Doctor, cum laude.
    <br> </br>
    Her previous offices include United States federal judge (2021–2022), and Vice Chair of the United States Sentencing Commission (2010–2014).
